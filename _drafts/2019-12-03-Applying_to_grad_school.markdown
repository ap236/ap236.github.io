I have been involved in the selection process at the Tinbergen Institute for a few years
and I noticed a few issues that can derail an application. Maybe this blog entry can help.
But note that I am writing this from the point of view of TI but I think many items will
carry over to other schools.

Reference Letters
-----------------

This is a bit of a black box for applicants. Yet, the letters are of crucial
importance. If something goes wrong with the letters then you will have a mountain to
climb to convince an admissions committee to let you in.

What can go wrong?

* Your letter writer is unfamiliar with the style of international reference letters.
This typically ends up in a short, uninformative letter that shines a poor light on the candidate.
Best to seek out letter writers that have been involved in placing students in international
graduate programmes.

* The letter writer doesn't know you. It can be difficult to stand out in large undergraduate
programmes. If you don't have someone who knows you because you have been in a small course or have
done some extra work, take the time to talk to your letter writer, so that they can write a more
informed letter.

* They need to be relevant. Letters from a member of your sports club will work against you no matter what they say.

Maths skills
-----------

There is an obsession with real analysis on social media. This may be overblown. Still,
graduate level econ courses require maths skills. If you haven't taken much maths, make sure
to add a couple of courses for two reasons. First, this will make grad school much
easier. Second, the admissions committee will be looking for signs of ability in maths.


Personal statement
------------------

This is your chance to show that you can think clearly and write coherently. Use it.

GRE
----

For candidates with non-Dutch degrees, this is required and  the less
familiar we are with your university the more useful it will be for us.
The Q score has a cut off but all three scores are looked at.


If you there are other items that I should discuss, then please drop me a line.
