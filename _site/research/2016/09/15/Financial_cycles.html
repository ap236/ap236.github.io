    <p><em>Disclaimer: This post (like all others) represents my opinion alone and should not be attributed to De Nederlandsche Bank, the Eurosystem or, indeed, anyone else.</em></p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Financial cycles, the way they are commonly defined, do not exist separately from the business cycle. Evidence for separate credit cycles is artificially constructed via a stock-flow mismatch.</p>

<p><br />
An increasing number of papers are appearing on the topic of financial cycles, including the papers presented at a <a href="https://www.dnb.nl/en/onderzoek-2/test-conferences/other-conferences/conferences/dnb345842.jsp">DNB workshop</a> I attended recently. In the papers of this workshop, financial cycles were defined as cycles in outstanding credit to the non-financial sector. The assumption is that credit cycles are distinct from business cycle as defined via GDP and that these different cycles are interesting to understand from a policy point of view.</p>

<p>As an example of what this might look like consider the graph below that plots consumption and investment (C+I) growth together with credit growth for the US.  I use consumption and investment growth as the credit plotted in the graph (and used in the papers of the workshop) is to the private, non-financial sector only.</p>

<p><img src="/pics/credit_growth.png" /></p>

<p>Notice that in the early and late 1970s and the mid 1980s credit growth does not seem to be synchronized with C+I growth. The most recent event where this divergence appeared was the
recovery from the financial crisis in 2009. C+I growth recovers relatively swiftly but credit growth has the trough only a few quarters later. This led Calvo and Loo-Kung to call the US recovery a “Phoenix miracle” in a <a href="http://voxeu.org/article/us-recovery-new-phoenix-miracle">VOX EU column</a>.</p>

<p>However, there is a major problem with the graph above:
consumption and investment are flow variables and credit is a stock variable;
comparing them is a stock-flow mismatch. This means that in the above graph the expenditures in a
given period are compared to the credit that firms and households have taken out in the past (and not repaid yet). However, it is fairly intuitive that expenditures in a given period are most closely related to borrowing of that period.
Together with Mike Biggs and Thomas Mayer, I discussed this problem in the context
of credit-less recoveries (<a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=1595980">Biggs et al., 2010</a>); a more
concise explanation of the issue is available in our <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/5038">VOX EU column</a>.</p>

<p>In place of the stock of credit, compare C+I to the flow of credit, that is, to the net new borrowing in each period (below I write how we approximate this).
In the graph below are C+I growth and the growth of the flow of credit, which <a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=1595980">Biggs et al. (2010)</a> call
the <em>credit impulse</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/pics/credit_impulse.png" /></p>

<p>It is clear that all the anomalies that appeared in the previous graph are now gone.
The recovery from the financial crisis  in 2009 are equally fast for C+I as for the flow of credit.</p>

<p>An important insight from the credit impulse is that economies can recover while they are deleveraging. The logic is simple: Assume your income is fixed at 100, and that you have to repay 10 units of currency in one period and 5 units in the next. In both periods, you are deleveraging but your consumption in the second period will be 5 units larger than in the first: consumption growth will be positive. This occurs while credit is still
shrinking (you are repaying 5) but the flow of credit has increased from -10 to -5.</p>

<p>How, then, did so many economist fall for a stock-flow mismatch?</p>

<p>My best guess, based on the presentations in the workshop, is the following. Assume that firms borrow to invest, pay interest r on existing credit, and investment is a fixed proportion of GDP.
Then</p>

<p>(1)        C(t) = (1+r) C(t-1) + I = (1+r) C(t-1) + g*Y</p>

<p>where C is the stock of credit, I is investment, Y is GDP, r is the interest rate, g is a constant,
and t denotes discrete time.
(And despite the notation, this is in discrete time – clearly, I need to get mathjax up and running.)</p>

<p>There is an equilibrium relationship between GDP and credit, which is</p>

<p>(2)          C = b*Y</p>

<p>where b is a constant that is comprised of the deeper parameters of the economy.
Hence, in equilibrium, the stock of credit and the flow of GDP are related.
<a href="http://www.suomenpankki.fi/en/julkaisut/tutkimukset/keskustelualoitteet/Pages/dp2016_03.aspx">Drehmann and Juselius (2016, Bank of Finland WP)</a> derive a similar equilibrium relationship (in a more elaborate model). They then assume that this equilibrium holds at all times except for
a disturbance term.</p>

<p>However, it is clear that</p>

<p>(3)         C(t) = b*Y(t) + e(t)</p>

<p>behaves fundamentally different from the dynamics in equation (1) from which
the equilibrium was derived.
As Brainard and Tobin (1968, AER, p.105) wrote:</p>

<p>“No one seriously believes that either the economy as a whole or its financial
subsector is continuously in an equilibrium. Equations like those of the model
described above do not hold every moment in time. […] There are, of course,
identities–e.g. balance sheet or income identities–that apply out of equilibrium
as well.”</p>

<p>For the description of financial crises and recoveries it should be clear that the
equilibrium is not a good description of the economy but that the credit identity will hold in each
period. Rewriting equation (1) yields</p>

<p>(4)          C(t) - (1-r) C(t-1) = g*Y</p>

<p>that is, domestic, private demand is related to the net <em>flow</em> of credit. A complication
is that the interest rates that are used for private credit is generally not
observed. It could be approximated by a 10 year corporate bond rate or a similar interest rate. In the graph above, I approximated the net flow by the difference of credit as I found in previous work that this yields a reasonably good approximation as long as interest rates are not too high.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I hope that it has become clear that credit cycles that are
distinct from the business cycle do not exist, that they should not be artificially
constructed via stock-flow mismatches, and that analyzing stock-flow mismatch relations
cannot lead to valid insights.</p>
