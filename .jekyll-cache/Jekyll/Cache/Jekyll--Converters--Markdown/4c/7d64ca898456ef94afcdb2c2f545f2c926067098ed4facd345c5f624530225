I"§<p>In this blog post, I make suggestions to avoid commonly made mistakes when
writing econometrics theses. There is more to academic writing than can fit into
a single blog post. Fortunately, much already seem to be well understood, so I will
focus on the issues that seem to go wrong more often. Naturally, the comments
reflect my own preferences. So when writing in other circumstances, take from
this what you will.</p>
