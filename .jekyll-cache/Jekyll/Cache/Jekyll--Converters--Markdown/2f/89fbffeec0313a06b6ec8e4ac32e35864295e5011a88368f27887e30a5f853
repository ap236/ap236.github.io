I"6<p>Here we go: new web site. Itâ€™s now largely written in markdown and rendered with <a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. The page is on <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a>. These changes allow me to include a blog with informative posts such as this one. So, dear reader, brace yourself.</p>
