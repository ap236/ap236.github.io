I"g<p>In this blog post, I address a few common mistakes made in  econometrics theses.
Naturally, there is more to academic writing than can fit into a single blog
post, so I will focus on the issues that seem to go wrong most often. Note, also
that the comments reflect my own preferences. When writing in other
circumstances, take from this what you will.</p>
