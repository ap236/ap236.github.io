I"`<p>In this blog post, I address a few common mistakes in the writing of
econometrics theses. As there is more to academic writing than can fit into a
single blog post, I will focus on the issues that seem to go wrong most
often. Naturally, the comments reflect my own preferences. When writing in other
circumstances, take from this what you will.</p>
