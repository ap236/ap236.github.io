I"#<p>In this blog post, I address common mistakes made when writing econometrics
theses. Naturally, there is more to academic writing than can fit into a single
blog post, so I will focus on the issues that seem to go wrong most often. Note,
also that the comments reflect my own preferences. When writing in other
circumstances, take from this what you will. Finally, this blog post is about
the academic side of writing not about English prose. I am semi-qualified to
talk about the former and definitely unqualified to talk about the latter.</p>
