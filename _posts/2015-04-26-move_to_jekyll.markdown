Recently, I geeked out and redesigned my web page for no good reason at all. I rewrote everything in markdown, rendering it with [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com). The page is now on [GitHub](http://www.github.com). This allows me to include a blog with informative posts such as this one. So, dear reader, brace yourself.

The redesign owes much [Frank Ditraglia](http://ditraglia.com)'s enthusiasm for GitHub and his blog post on Jekyll. You may notice the similarity of Frank's and my web sites as both use the default style of Jekyll.
